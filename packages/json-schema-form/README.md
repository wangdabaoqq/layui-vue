Json-schema-form is a high-level component encapsulated on the basis of @layui/layui-vue form.

```
import App from './App';
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import LayJsonSchemaForm from "@layui/json-schema-form";
import "@layui/json-schema-form/lib/index.css";

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(LayJsonSchemaForm).mount('#app');
```
